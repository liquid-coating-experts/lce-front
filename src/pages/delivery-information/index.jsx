          All Items must be signed for and inspected immediately. Any missing
          items or damage needs to be reported within a reasonable time frame of
          48 hours, so even if you are not installing your item straight-away,
          please thoroughly inspect the item upon delivery otherwise there is no
          practical way for us to determine whether it was damaged before
          receipt of your item & we will not be able to make a damage claim with
          our couriers or the manufacturer.
